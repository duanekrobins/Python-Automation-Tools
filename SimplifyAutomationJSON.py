# Simplify JSON for Cypress Test Generation
# Developer: Duane Robinson
# Date: April 21, 2024
# Purpose: This script processes complex JSON files used for test automation, extracting critical test step information 
#          and converting it into a simplified format that's easier to translate into Cypress test scripts.
